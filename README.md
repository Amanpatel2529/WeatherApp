# Weatherapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.


## Project Description

**Weather App using Angular and OpenWeatherMap API**

This project demonstrates a simple weather application built using Angular. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on a user-entered city. The application displays essential weather information such as city, country, temperature, feels like, humidity, and wind speed in a user-friendly table format. 

**Key features:**

* User input for city search
* Fetches weather data using OpenWeatherMap API
* Displays weather information in a clear and organized table format
* Basic error handling for API requests

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex weather applications with additional features like weather forecasts, maps, and visualizations.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
